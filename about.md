# about me

I'm currently a Data Scientist (Product Analytics) at Facebook Ads, based in Seattle. My job involves collecting user signals on Facebook family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger) and off Facebook, and resolving the true user identities behind these signals. My teams sometimes [get featured on the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636). In my day-to-day, I use Presto/Spark extensively, and Python/R for analysis/visualization. 

Before Facebook, I worked as a Business Consultant at [Applied Predictive Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_Predictive_Technologies), selling business experimentation/enterprise-level A/B testing solutions. Even before that, I earned a Bachelor of Science and Engineering degree from Princeton University, with a minor in Finance. 

You can find my Linkedin page and ways to contact at the bottom of the page. 

In my free time, I love reading, hiking, snowboarding, watching/playing rugby, and occasionally maintaining this blog.
