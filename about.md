# About me

I'm a Business Consultant working for Applied Predictive Technologies. Before this, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science and Engineering degree from Princeton University.

You can find my Linkedin page and ways to contact at the bottom of the page. 

In my free time, I love reading, hiking, watching/playing basketball.
