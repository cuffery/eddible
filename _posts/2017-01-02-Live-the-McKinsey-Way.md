I suspect every business school student, every management consultant and every consultant-wanna-be have read or bought this book, and for a very good reason: it offers a rare glimpse into one of the world's most elite and successful business organizations, McKinsey and Company. 

It's almost a shame for me that it took me this long to read a book with such big font and wide margin; but nevertheless prolonging the reading process (which was definitely planned btw) has given me plenty opportunities to use the book as a lens from 30,000 feet above the ground to examine my day-to-day life as a consultant. This hopefully helps drive to a more balanced **verdict** (in contrary to the most 1-start reviews you would find on Amazon):

>**It offers quite a number of golden nuggets - insights that are helpful for beginners, altought most of the book contains generic trite that you will find in any consulting books.**

It's not a book that offers earth-shattering truths or McKinsey's proprietary knowledge (you really shouldn't expect so in the first place); instead, it serves more of a quick primer for someone with absolutely no idea of consulting or McKinsey. The book's insight can really be summarized into 3 pages or my single post (which is this one); **so don't buy it, but really read it before your junior year recruiting season, or before you begin your job as a consultant.**  

Here's a breakdown of the book in terms of **the key concepts** that I find useful: 

-**The MECE Rule:** (perhaps the most famous) MCEC stands for "mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive"; and it is evident as the Firm pursues clarity of thought and expression. Not just consultants, but everyone should observe this rule of MCEC whenever possible in their thinking process and communications, in order to achieve the best possible solution. 

-McKinsey's approach is summarized into **3 pillars**: 

	1. Fact-based
	2. Rigidly structured
	3. Hypothesis driven

While I think this is awesome and should be **the general structure for problem-solving everywhere**, my time so far at APT has added the following guidelines to my go-to framework:

	1. Analytically rigorous
	2. Statistically significant (and beware of the common pitfall of p-values)
	3. Actionable (an insight is worthless if the client can't act on it or implement it easily)

-Common **tools** and **frameworks** that McKinsey consultants use (or really just any consultant at MBB): (this section also contains a ton of consulting jargons that if not used properly, become nonsense/bs/jibberish very quickly and easily)

	1. 80/20 Rule: 
	The most commonly used phrase, saying 80% of your results come from 20% of your work, 80% of your sales come from 20% of your clients, etc - this is definitely a rule every consultant lives by. It echoes the larger point, which is prioritization. This is also a great segway into my post yesterday on "The ONE Thing", as you should recognize your "ONE Thing" that will deliver you the most value, and go after it. 

	2. Don't boil the Oceanï¼š 
	Work smarter, not harder! Well the assumption is that you will always work hard, 

	3. Find the KEY DRIVERS (that affect your business)
	
	4. The Elevator Test (You should be able to explain your solution in 30 seconds)

	5. Seize every small opportunities while solving a problem (these will boost the morale and your credibility among the clients)

	6. Always think of the big picture:
	This

	7. Learn to say "I don't know":
	Always have humility! Definitely a good reminder as consultants tend to 

	8. Don't accept "I have no idea"
